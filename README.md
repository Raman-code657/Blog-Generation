# 📝 Blog Generation App

The **Blog Generation App** is an AI-powered project that automatically generates blog content using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
It is designed with a **graph-based architecture** that connects different components like nodes, states, and workflows for flexible and extensible content creation.
